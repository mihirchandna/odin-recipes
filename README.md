# odin-recipes
We created a new repository on our github odin-recipes.
We cloned it our local git.
Then we basically created a index that transfers us to other relative links.
I created three of those recipe cards Paneer tikka, naan, sirka pyaaz.
We first start off by giving them an appropriate title then a photo.
Giving It a description.
Then we make an unordered list of its ingredients.
I kept using ls instead of li.
Finally we also made the steps to cook the dish in an ordered list.
And then pushed it all to our repository that we created at the beginning.
